# Forecasting Demand in Chicago’s Emerging E-Scooter Market Using Spatiotemporal Analysis


## Overview
The work documented in this repository was submitted as a Capstone Project in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science in Analytics at the University of Chicago. The project focuses on leveraging time series modeling to optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and facilitate revenue growth for e-scooter companies in Chicago through forecasting e-scooter availability.

## Project Abstract
The project Forecasting Demand in Chicago’s Emerging Electric Scooter (ie. E-Scooter) Market Using Spatiotemporal Analyses employed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast e-scooter demand in Chicago. The primary objective was to optimize resource allocation and facilitate revenue growth for e-scooter companies. By combining the LSTM model with a supply-demand analysis, we identified three key communities with low supply yet high demand where targeted demand could increase quarterly revenue by 3% to 5%. These predictions offer practical findings that enhance operational efficiency. Furthermore, by integrating auxiliary datasets like weather conditions, our analysis explored spatiotemporal patterns, providing insights into user behavior and geographical utilization.

## Our Approach
- Challenge: E-scooter companies face a trade-off between underestimating and overestimating demand.
  - Underestimation: Leads to missed revenue opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.
  - Overestimation: Results in increased operational costs and unused resources.
- Opportunity: By leveraging advanced demand forecasting, companies can strategically position e-scooters, ensuring availability in high-demand areas and gaining a competitive edge in the market.

By integrating spatiotemporal and external datasets, our model effectively captures demand fluctuations across different locations and times. This approach enables e-scooter companies to:
- Maximize customer satisfaction by meeting demand.
- Optimize resource allocation to reduce costs.
- Gain a competitive advantage through precise forecasting.
