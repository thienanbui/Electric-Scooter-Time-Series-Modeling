## Project Abstract
The project Forecasting Demand in Chicago’s Emerging Electric Scooter Market Using Spatiotemporal Analyses employed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast e-scooter demand in Chicago. The primary objective was to optimize resource allocation and facilitate revenue growth for e-scooter companies. By combining the LSTM model with a supply-demand analysis, we identified three key communities with low supply yet high demand where targeted demand could increase quarterly revenue by 3% to 5%. These predictions offer practical findings that enhance operational efficiency. Furthermore, by integrating auxiliary datasets like weather conditions, our analysis explored spatiotemporal patterns, providing insights into user behavior and geographical utilization.
